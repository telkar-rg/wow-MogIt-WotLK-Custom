## [MogIt-WotLK](https://github.com/telkar-rg/wow-MogIt-WotLK)

MogIt is an in-game catalogue of items with the aim of helping players build their own sets for transmogrification purposes.

This custom module is for loading secondary or custom content/items without modifying the base files.  
**This contains no data of it's own.  It is purely for users who wish to add their server's custom data to MogIt**

**How do I add an item to MogIt?**  
Insert the following line into the itemtype file you want it to show up in with filled in data types:
```i(itemID,display,"name",itemLevel,quality,levelReq,faction,class,bind,slot,sheath,source,sourceid,zone,sourceinfo) ```  
Any of these fields can be replaced with "nil".

- After loading the Custom module in game, the item(s) will be added to MogIt. 
- The default MogIt_Custom addon loads all additions into a "Custom" slot of the Accessories module, but this can be changed.
- Additional slots can be added as well by creating a new file and adding it to MogIt_Custom.toc, through this method you can have "Custom" slots under various weapon or armor modules.

## Notes:
 - Any of these fields can be replaced with "nil".
 - Display does not necessarily need to be the DisplayID of the item, it is an identifier used to group items by appearance (some items have the same appearance but different display IDs).
 - Name, Item Level, and Quality will auto-populate when the item is cached.  These fields are filler for sorting/filtering on uncached items.
 - The Slot ID filter only shows up on One-handed weapon types.
 - SourceID is the NPC ID or Quest ID that the item is obtained from.
 - Zone ID is the Area ID the item is found in.  Note:  Zone IDs and Area IDs are different, this uses [Area ID](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/WorldMapAreaID).
